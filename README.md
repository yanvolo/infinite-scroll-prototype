# Infinite Scrolling Prototypes

The Master Branch includes the base boilerplate. A large table of 10,000 entries built from Urigo's Biolerplate configeration from https://github.com/Urigo/angular-meteor with entries generated by anti:fake.

We will build new branches as we test new packages and techniques, and they will also be listed here as they develop:

## [Ngx-infinite-scroll] (https://www.npmjs.com/package/ngx-infinite-scroll)

There is also a version available for angular 2 called something along the lines of [ng2-… infinite scroll](https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular2-infinite-scroll), which I think might be of interest considering we use a bootstrap of the same prefix and it appears that scidap uses angular 2. 

This version was the easiest to configure, as it is simply a directive that can be easily applied to HTML directly and used to call a single method in the script to append more data. 

Note that if we plan to use Mongo Observables, like this boilerplate did, angular’s “async” display only displays the last received item from the stream, meaning that Mongo sends the entire table every time when queried, so it will take a bit, but not too much, to fiddle with the stream to minimize network traffic.

Right now, I just have a client side array that I append to whenever I get new data, which  will result in issues if the table is changed when the user is on the page (ordering could get messed up, duplicate entries, etc), but for small sets, this would work well and it would be easy to set up a stream that minimizes network traffic.
